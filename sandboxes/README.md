# Sandboxes

Tiny starter projects and drop-in templates to try patterns quickly.

- React Native (Expo): see `react-native-expo/` — run locally with Expo.
- .NET Minimal API: see `dotnet-minimal-api/` — run with `dotnet run`.
- .NET MAUI: see `dotnet-maui/` — copy files into a new MAUI app.
- Android (Compose): see `android-compose/` — open in Android Studio.
- iOS (SwiftUI): see `ios-swiftui/` — copy into a new Xcode project.
- Flutter: see `flutter/` — run with `flutter run`.

Note: Native mobile projects rely on platform SDKs. Use the README in each sandbox for setup details.
