# .NET Patterns (C#)

Practical patterns for ASP.NET Core and .NET MAUI. Each guide includes a live end-to-end example you can copy/paste.

- Architecture
  - [MVVM with CommunityToolkit](./maui-mvvm-toolkit.md)
  - [Clean Architecture (API + Application + Domain + Infrastructure)](./clean-architecture.md)
- Data & HTTP
  - [Repository + DTO mapping with HttpClient](./repository-httpclient-dto.md)
  - [Caching with IMemoryCache/IDistributedCache](./caching-imemorycache.md)
- DI & Messaging
  - [Dependency Injection with Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection](./di-built-in.md)
  - [Mediator pattern with MediatR](./mediatr-requests.md)

Tip: start from these in a sandbox project, then extract stable pieces into your layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure).
