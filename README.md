# modern-app-patterns

Practical, copy‑pasteable patterns for modern app development. Every guide has a live, end‑to‑end example you can drop into a project (modder’s approach: copy, paste, tweak).

Currently covers React Native (TypeScript), Android (Kotlin/Compose), and iOS (Swift/SwiftUI). More tech can be added later.

## What’s inside

- Architecture: MVVM, MVI, Clean Architecture
- State: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, React Query, StateFlow/Flow, ObservableObject
- Data: Repository + DTO/Codable/Retrofit/Room, caching (AsyncStorage/MMKV)
- DI & Navigation: Hilt, protocol-based DI, React Navigation, Expo Router, Jetpack, Coordinators
- Live examples: Copy/paste flows for each pattern

## Browse by platform

- React Native: see `react-native/README.md`
- Android (Kotlin): see `android-kotlin/README.md`
- iOS (Swift): see `ios-swift/README.md`

## Quick start

1. Pick a pattern from the platform index (for example, React Query in RN).
2. Copy the live end‑to‑end example into your sandbox app.
3. Tweak names, URLs, or types to match your project.

## How to navigate

- Each page starts with the pattern idea, then a focused example.
- “Live end-to-end example” sections provide minimal, runnable flows.
- Notes call out trade‑offs, tips, and when to use the pattern.

## Contributing

- PRs for new patterns, fixes, or additional platforms are welcome.
- Keep examples short, idiomatic, and ready to paste.
